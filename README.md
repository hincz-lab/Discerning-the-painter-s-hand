# machine learning for art attribution
## Code associated with the work "Discerning the painterâ€™s hand:  machine learning on surface topography".
## Introduction
In this report, we examine these hypotheses using a controlled study of bespoke paintings by several artists that mimic certain workshop practices. A series of twelve paintings by four artists, and their associated topographical profiles, is subject to analysis to attribute the works and to ascertain the important properties involved in that attribution. Our use of common materials and subject matter among the artists creates a stronger focus on individual stylistic components and reflects the properties and goals of workshop paintings. The methods and controls we employ here are suited to each individual task: namely, to isolate stylistic components, to test the efficacy ML techniques on surface topography for proper attribution among several artists, to determine the length scales involved in the ML results, to compare with photographic ML, and to provide a basis for later studies on workshop paintings.
